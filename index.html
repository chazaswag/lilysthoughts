			<h2><u>Hi, I'm Lily!</u></h2>
				<p class="info" >
				Hi I am lily. I like experimenting with art, music, games and stuff like that!
				<br><br>In terms of music, I am pretty new! I've been making some instrumental, video game-inspired music.
				Each track has it's its own feel as I try to get to grips with making music LOL.
				<br><br>I also love the idea of game design, i have a few smaller projects that I have started overtime!
				(don’t get too excited though...).
				<br><br>This page is mostly just to hold information for me...
				Check above for links of platforms I am on, as well as a gallery of art n stuff!
				<br><br>If you interested in more like. Actual stuff I have done.
				Check below it is a bigger intro to me.

				In June of 2024 I released "Look Ahead!" It is an EP based around the idea of an RPG following 3 kids
				and their journey up a mountain. <a onclick="boxtoggle(4);">The art</a> was done by my good friend drew, 
				and the full EP was made in about a month or so.
				It is video game inspired, specifically celeste with a mix of some chiptune songs and some other styles.
				<br><br>
				It is pretty short but itis worth checking out (if u wanna u can listen below, as well
				as spotify, soundcloud and bandcamp + many others)

				In November 2024 I released a second, shorter EP of 4 songs. It is called "Lonely Space Bunny Music."
				<br><br>
				It is about a lonely space bunny, hence the name.She is called Amie. She is alone, on a space station.
				She has been alone for a long time. <br><br> You can listen to it below :>

				<br><br>Something else I do a bunch every now and again is modding. I have released quite a few mods on gamebanana.
				Some fixing games, some dumb jokes and some quality of life changes. Most notable are my Bendy and The Ink Machine mods.
				Quality of Life (which is now outdated LOL) , is probably my best bendy mod I made, it is linked below.
				<ul><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/471415"><img src="https://gamebanana.com/mods/embeddables/471415?type=large"/></a>
				</ul>
				<br><br>
				In 2023 I released a few mods that fixed several core issues with the games code
				My quality of life mod ended up becoming an update to the game with the help of one of the lead programmers.
				Which is like maybe the coolest bragging rights.<br><br>
